# FizzBuzz Kata

This is a Kata for practicing TDD.
We have to write a program that:
* Writes the numbers from 1 to 100.
* When the value is 0, it has to print "".
* When the value is 3, it has to print "Fizz".
* When the value is 5, it has to print "Buzz".
* When the value is multiple of 3, it has to print "Fizz".
* When the value is multiple of 5, it has to print "Buzz".
* When the value is multiple of 3 and 5, it has to print "FizzBuzz".
* When the value has a 3 in it, it has to print "Fizz".
* When the value has a 5 in it, it has to print "Buzz".
* When the value has a 3 and a 5 in it, it has to print "FizzBuzz".
